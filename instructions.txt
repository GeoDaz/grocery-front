As you can see, I've created a basic nextjs application
The application allows you to create multiple lists of groceries, manage the quantity of each item. You can check off items as you add them to your cart.
There is a search bar where you can type in food. 
you can see the nutritional content of each foodstuff depending of the grammage : vitamins, minerals, lipids, carbohydrates, etc.
There is an authentication system in place to ensure that only authorized users can access the application.
It works with next-auth, an EmailProvider with NestJs and a GoogleProvider.
You can add other users to the application by email address.
